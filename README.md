# SysLinEq
Solve systems of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method.

## About
A small program that solves matrices using the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method.
Written for my CS121 class to demonstrate OOP.

## Usage
1. Run the app.
1. Input your augmented matrix.
1. You'll be asked if you want to generate solution.
1. Wait for the steps to finish. (If chosen to generate solution.)
1. You'll be left with the matrix's reduced row echelon form.
1. A solution set will be parsed after displaying the reduced row echelon form.
